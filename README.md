## Projects description

TBW

## Requirements

Code was tested on Windows 11, Python 3.12

All the requirement packages are listed in the file `pyproject.toml`

## Before start

We recommend using [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for project setup and management.
You can start with `uv sync`.

Optionally, you can run `bash setup_precommit.sh` to setup pre-commit hook for GitHub for code formatting using [ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/).

We also highly recommend reading report to fully understand context and purpose of some files and folders.
